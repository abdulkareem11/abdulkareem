<h1>MY ACHIEVEMENT</h1>
<p>My name is Abdul kareem Ayinla. i have been opportuned to gain admission in the world class university, Kwara state university. I see achievement as
 an award for completing a particular task or meeting specific goals. It is a successful
acomplishment,looking back the years it has been amazing but the one i can never forget which i term as a 
notable achievement was when i was selected as the one of the most brilliant student back in my junior secondary school days.
I was well recognized with the nickname<i>sinzzu</i> and few people look up on then in secondary school,because i broke the
unbreakable record.I was very good at sporting activities especially field events such as football, handball, and basketball. 
I keep training physically and mentally to be 
outstanding in what i do<br>
A well known football competition in which most known secondary schools participate was around the corner and everyone
is preparing for the competition.I devoted my time,energy and prayers there just to make sure i make my
team proud.To God be the glory as luck found me and i was the best young footballer in kwara state among all footballers that 
gathered for the competition<br>
<pr>Indeed it was an incredible achievement that brought smile on my face.</p>
